          Mortgage insurance and related products go by several different names

              Offered by banks, lender-provided mortgage insurance is designed
              to cover only the outstanding mortgage balance. This ensures the
              mortgage is paid off and protects the lender, but your loved ones
              have no control over the payout.

            <p>
              Mortgage default insurance, commonly referred to as CMHC
              insurance, is mandatory if the down payment is less than 20%. It
              does not cover your mortgage in the event of death or disability.

              Mortgage protection insurance:
            </h4>
            <p>
              Mortgage protection insurance is a type of term life insurance
              that matches your mortgage amount and term. In the event of your
              death, the payout is made directly to your family, giving them
              control over the funds.

              Is mortgage life insurance worth it?
            </h4>
            <p>
              One of the main benefits of mortgage protection insurance quotes
              is its affordability. For instance, adding mortgage protection can
              cost only $30 to $40 CAD per month. Additionally, itâ€™s often
              easier to qualify for mortgage protection insurance than
              traditional life insurance.
