          What is whole life Insurance in Canada?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-halfBlack text-dg">
          Whole life insurance in Canada is a type of permanent life insurance
          that guarantees a payout whenever you pass away, as it has no
          expiration date. Unlike term life insurance, which covers a specific
          period, whole life insurance provides lifelong protection.
          <br />
          <br />
          One of the key feature of whole life insurance is its fixed premiums
          throughout the contract period. In addition to providing life
          coverage, it also includes a cash value component. This cash value
          grows over time and can be used for various financial needs, like
          supplementing retirement income or funding your childrenâ€™s education.
